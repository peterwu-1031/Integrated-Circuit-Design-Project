# Introduction
### 1. This project designed a circuit (SW.v) with 16 PEs to perform Smith-Waterman Algorithm on 64-bits reference and 48-bits query.
### 2. The circuit (SW.v) was synthesized with Synopsys Design Compiler (to SW_syn.v) and the APR process was done with Cadence Innovus (to SW_APR.v). 
### 3. The details of synthesis are in SW_area/power/timing.txt and the details of APR are in summaryReport.rpt
